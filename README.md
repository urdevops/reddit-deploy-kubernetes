# Deploying Reddit Clone Web App on Kubernetes Cluster: A Step-by-Step Guide

## Introduction

Container orchestration with Kubernetes has become a standard for deploying and managing applications efficiently. In this detailed guide, we will walk you through the process of deploying a Reddit clone web application onto a Kubernetes cluster hosted on AWS. By following these steps, you will not only learn the deployment process but also gain insights into the power of Kubernetes for managing containerized applications.

## Use Cases of This Project 🌐

This Reddit clone web application deployed on a Kubernetes cluster has several potential use cases with minimal modifications:

- Multi-Tenant Web Hosting: Host multiple instances of the Reddit clone for different users or organizations within the same Kubernetes cluster.

- Load Balancing: Easily scale your Reddit clone horizontally by adjusting the number of replicas in the Deployment, ensuring high availability and improved performance.

- Microservices Architecture: Extend this project by breaking down your Reddit clone into microservices, each running in its own container, and manage them efficiently with Kubernetes.

- API Gateway: Integrate an API gateway to manage and secure access to different services within your application, making it more robust and secure.


## Step 1: Provision AWS Instances 🌐

Begin by accessing the AWS console and creating two instances with specific configurations:

**Deployment Server:**
- AMI: Ubuntu
- Type: t2.medium

Ensure that you name these instances accordingly for easy reference.

## Step 2: Clone the Code📂

Clone the codebase of your Reddit clone web application.

## Step 3: Prerequisites 🛠️

**On Deployment Server:**
- Update the server: `sudo apt-get update`
- Install Docker: `sudo apt-get install docker.io -y`
- Give permission to Docker: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker`
- Install Minikube and Kubectl:
    ```bash
    curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
    sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube
    sudo snap install kubectl — classic
    minikube start — driver=docker
    ```

## Step 4: Write a Dockerfile for the Project 🐳

Create a Dockerfile for your Reddit clone project with the following content:

```Dockerfile
FROM node:19-alpine3.15

WORKDIR /reddit-clone

COPY . /reddit-clone

RUN npm install

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm","run","dev"]
```

## Step 5: Build and Push Docker Image 🚀


## Step 6: Connect to Deployment Server 🖥️

SSH into the Deployment Server.

## Step 7: Install Minikube and Kubectl

Ensure Minikube and Kubectl are installed on the Deployment Server.

## Step 8: Deploy Docker Image 🚢

Now, it's time to deploy the Docker image from Docker Hub onto your Kubernetes cluster.

## Step 9: Create a Kubernetes Folder 📁
Create a folder named "K8s" on the Deployment Server.

## Step 10: Create a Deployment YAML File 📝
Inside the "K8s" folder, create a file named "Deployment.yml" and add the following content:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: reddit-clone-deployment
  labels:
    app: reddit-clone
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: reddit-clone
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: reddit-clone
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: reddit-clone
          image: urdevops/reddit-clone
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000

```

## Step 11: Apply the Deployment File 📜
Apply the Deployment file to create pods:

```
kubectl apply -f Deployment.yml

```


## Step 12: Verify Deployments 🧐
To ensure that the deployments are successful, use the following command:

```
kubectl get deployments

```

## Step 13: Create a Kubernetes Service 🌐
Now, you need to create a Service to provide an IP address for your application within the cluster.


## Step 14: Create a Service YAML File 📝
Inside the "K8s" folder, create a file named "Service.yml" and add the following content:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: reddit-clone-service
  labels:
    app: reddit-clone
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - port: 3000
      targetPort: 3000
      nodePort: 31000
  selector:
    app: reddit-clone

```

## Step 15: Apply the Service File 📜
Apply the Service file to create a service:

```
kubectl apply -f Service.yml

```

## Step 16: Check the Service 🌐
To verify that the service is created successfully, run:

```
kubectl get services

```

## Step 17: Access the Application 🚀
You can now access your application by visiting the URL provided by Minikube:

```
minikube service reddit-clone-service — url

```

## Step 18: Expose the Application to the Internet 🌍
To make your application accessible from the internet, you'll need to configure port forwarding.

## Step 19: Port Forwarding 🔄
Run the following command for port forwarding:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/reddit-clone-service 3000:3000 –address 0.0.0.0

```

## Step 20: Access Your Live Reddit Clone 🌐

Visit your Reddit Clone web app at the provided domain or IP address, and it should now be accessible to the world.
